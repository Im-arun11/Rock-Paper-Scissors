 Rock Paper Scissors (Console Game)

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using JavaScript 
The game runs completely in the browser console, where the player competes against the computer.

 Features

  Console-based gameplay  
  Randomized computer choices  
  Repeats automatically on a draw  
  Simple logic and clean code  
  Great for beginners learning functions and loops  

 How It Works

1. The player is prompted to enter either rock, paper, or scissors.  
2. The computer generates a random choice using Math.random().  
3. The function playRound() determines the result:
   1. Returns "Won" if the player beats the computer  
   2. Returns "Lost" if the computer wins  
   3. Returns "Again" if it’s a draw (and restarts the loop)
